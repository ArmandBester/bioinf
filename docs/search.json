We used universal primers to amplify the 16s rDNA gene from the genomic DNA we isolated.

Use the spacebar to slide the pattern along the subject while paying attention to matching characters. Can you find the optimal alignment?\nIn the above exercise, the pattern is found exactly in the subject, this is not always the case, we can still do an optimum alignment in the case of substitutions and even insertions and deletions. Although exact matching algorithms are used in bioinformatics (like finding restriction sites), these will not work in most cases where we expect genetic variation.\nTask 1.1: Below you will see a picture numerically marked with alignment features.\nTask 1.2: What is peculiar or noteworthy about the 3 rd feature from the image of an alignment above? Anyone can count to 3, that is not what I am interested in. Why 3? I want you to speculate whether the section shown in the alignment is part of a coding or non-coding area of a gene.

    "text": "Before we get to phylogenetics let’s look at some iris data. As with many other bioinformatic techniques, phylogenetics stems from older methods. Hierarchical clustering is a form of unsupervised machine learning and unlike some of the other methods of this kind, you do not have to specify the number of clusters you want prior to the analysis. The picture below illustrates what we will be looking at.\nThe ‘iris’ dataset is quite famous and is used in many books and tutorials on machine learning. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set\nThe data set consists of four different attributes, namely: sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width (all measured in cm). There are 50 observations for each class and they are like in the image above, versicolor, setosa and virginica.\nI could show you the data, but let’s rather look at some fun plots.\nLoading required package: ggplot2\n\n\nRegistered S3 method overwritten by 'GGally':\n  method from   \n  +.gg   ggplot2\n\n\n  Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species\n1          5.1         3.5          1.4         0.2  setosa\n2          4.9         3.0          1.4         0.2  setosa\nThe pairs plotted above plot each attribute or variable against each. Why would this be useful?\nFrom the above plot, it is now clear that petal length and width are the attributes which are most discriminating between the 3 different flower species. So if we would like to group these into clusters based on their attributes the above-mentioned would do the best job. Also, remember that the attributes are measured in cm which means that we can use this numeric data to construct a distance matrix. Once we have a distance matrix we can create a dendrogram. So how would we calculate the distance between observations? Remember we have 150 observations, 50 of each specie. We would like to calculate the distance of each observation against each. If you now think about that, if we plot these distances, they should form clusters.\nHow do we calculate distances? Remember Pythagoras’s theorem?\nOr do you remember getting the distance between two points on a cartesian coordinate system, the image below should help.\nSo how do we calculate the distance (d) between points (x1, y1) and (x2,y2)?\nWe can see from the above image that we mostly managed to correctly cluster the iris species."

Think of sentiment analysis from social media platforms to determine what people are thinking and feeling about an organization. As an example of this, in 2014 sentiment analysis was used to determine what people are thinking about the personalized genomics company, 23andMe. You can download the report here. The authors of this presentation collected Twitter feeds (tweets) for one week to determine how people are feeling about this company and what were the general reasons for interest.\nSimilarly, bioinformatics uses information generated from a biological context as data or information for analysis. As you can realize that is extremely broad! Solving the crystal structure of an enzyme using X-ray crystallography is quite different from analyzing a novel metabolic pathway.\nHave a look at this publication.\nHowever, this blog, will mostly deal with nucleic sequence analysis and introduce you to the very basics."
